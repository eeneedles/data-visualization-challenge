This is an anaysis of data from a 45 day study of mice with squamous cell carcinoma tumors treated with a range of drug regimens.  Matplotlib is used to plot a variety of graphs presenting the analysis of the data.  This repository includes a README file and a folder containing a jupiter notebook file with all the code for the project and a second folder containing two csv files for the mice included in the study and the timepoints when data was collected.
The csv files were merged into a single DataFrame and the data was filtered to show the number of unique mice IDs and to check for duplicate time points.  The duplicate data was removed for accuracy.  A summary statistics table was created to show the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volumes.
This project is unfinished but will inlude matplotlibcharts showing the distribution of male vs. female mice, the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group, tumor volume over time for a mouse treated with the Capomulin regimen, correlation, and linear regression of mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
